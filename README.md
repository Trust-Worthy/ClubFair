# ClubFair

**ClubFair** is a simple web app that helps college students coordinate their academic, work, and club schedules — removing the confusion and chaos from finding time to be involved on campus.

---

##  Purpose

College life is demanding. Between new class schedules, part-time jobs, and extracurricular activities, it’s hard for students to figure out when they’re actually free to meet with clubs or attend events. 

**ClubFair** exists to solve that. Instead of flipping between calendars and chat apps, students can:

- Import their weekly school schedule
- Organize and visualize their availability
- Discover and filter club events that match their real-life availability

It’s like a smart “club-finder” that respects your time.
